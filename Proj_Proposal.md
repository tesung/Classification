Project Proposal

Question/Goal: To predict whether or not a client qualifies for a credit card. 

Data: 

I downloaded a data set from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction?select=application_record.csv) that contains client data including their credit card application, financial status, and debt information. My target will be debt status and ultimately a decision will be made as approved vs. not approved. I expect to work with features such as client ID, gender, income, education, employement, debt, ownership, marital status etc.

Tools:

Python, scikit learn, feature engineering
Testing/validation with logistic regression and knn modeling
Visualization with plotly
Deployment with Flask or streamlit
