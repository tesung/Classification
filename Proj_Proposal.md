Project Proposal

Question/Goal: To predict whether or not a transaction is fraudulent.

Data: 

I downloaded a data set from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vardhansiramdasu/fraudulent-transactions-prediction) that contains client data including the transaction type, amount, destination, and whether or not it was flagged as fraudulent. My target will be fraudulent or not. I expect to work with features such as client ID, transfer type, amount, recipient, and whether or not a transaction is flagged as fraud. 

Tools:

Python, scikit learn, feature engineering
Testing/validation with logistic regression, KNN confusion matrix, recall metric, ROC curve.
Visualization with plotly
